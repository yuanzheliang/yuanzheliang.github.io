*i*-MemTec Lab Mission:
======
The *innovation* in Membrane Technology for Circular Economy (*i*-MemTec) Lab aims to pioneer advanced membrane technology for a circular economy of nutrients, energy, and water ("NEW") resources.

The *i*-MemTec Lab seeks to educate the next generation of materials scientists and environmental engineers, and engage with the broad community to provide solutions to local and global challenges around clean water, food security and energy efficiency through interdisciplinary and collaborative research.

*i*-MemTec Lab Strategy:
======
We specialize in combining interfacial engineering, process modeling and data science to identify and catalyze transformative solutions, technologies, and practices that promote sustainability across multiple domains, such as water, energy, agriculture, waste management, and resource utilization.

We recruit lab members that embody diversity, self-motivation, a sense of adventure, persistence, enthusiasm, collaboration, supportiveness, and a love for fun. Each member is valued, and we are committed to nurturing their growth by designing Individual Development Plans (IDPs). IDPs serve as roadmaps to explore and define their training goals, professional development needs, and career objectives. We provide mentoring, guidance, and resources, in both scientific and career development, to support their goals.

We encourage internal and external collaborations with intellectually diverse scholars and enhance the impact of our research accomplishments.

*i*-MemTec Lab Value:
======
At the *i*-MemTec Lab, we foster a collaborative, innovative, and respectful research environment where curiosity and discovery drive our work. Our lab stands as a dynamic hub of discovery, collaboration, innovation, growth, and respect, where passionate researchers come together to tackle complex challenges and make a lasting impact on society. We value diverse perspectives and expertise, maintaining a supportive and professional workspace where all members can contribute, grow, and excel in their scientific endeavors.
