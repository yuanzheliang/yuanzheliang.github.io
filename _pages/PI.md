## About me

Greetings! I'm Yuanzhe Liang (梁元喆), and I hail from Taiyuan, Shanxi Province, China, where I was both born and raised. Growing up in the arid region of the Loess Plateau, I witnessed firsthand the severe impact of drought on the majority of areas, which ignited my unwavering drive to tackle the global water crisis. Early in my education, I was motivated to develop high-performance membranes for more efficient and precise water purification. Later in my career, I expanded my research scope from interfacial engineering of membrane materials to system-level development of membrane technologies, seeking solutions to a new array of challenges. These encompassed high-salinity brine management, emerging contamination treatment, trace metal extraction, nutrients recovery, biomass conversion, plastic recycling and more. 

The immense potential of future membrane technologies filled me with excitement and solidified my determination to pursue a career in research and education. The *i*-MemTec Lab aims to propel membrane technology forward, catalyzing solutions for the transition towards a circular economy of nutrients, energy, and water ("NEW") resources. Simultaneously, my lab endeavors to nurture the next generation of materials scientists and environmental engineers, equipping them with the knowledge and skills to make a positive impact on society.
